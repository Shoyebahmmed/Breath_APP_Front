A puffer, or a metered dose inhaler, is the most common type of inhaler. Using it with a spacer will get more medicine into the lungs.

Tips for correct use - 

•   Shake the inhaler before use.

•   Breathe out fully.

•   Hold the inhaler in the right position.

•   Breathe in deeply as you puff the medicine into your mouth, then hold your breath for as long as possible (and for at least 5 seconds).

•   Make sure you shake the inhaler in between puffs.
