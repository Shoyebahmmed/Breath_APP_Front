When asthma is not under control, the airways become inflamed. Inflammation of the airways causes asthma symptoms (wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing) by restricting or limiting the airflow to and from the lungs.


•   The airways become red and swollen, which makes them narrower. This can often take several hours or days to develop and may take just as long to reverse after the asthma attack has passed.

•   Tightening of the muscles that surround the airways (also called bronchoconstriction) makes them even narrower. This tightening can happen very quickly, depending on the type of trigger and underlying inflammation.

•   The airways make more mucus, which can plug up or partly block the airways.


Attacks can range from mild to severe.
