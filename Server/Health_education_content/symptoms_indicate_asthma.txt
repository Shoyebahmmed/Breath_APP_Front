People with asthma experience symptoms because of the inflammation and narrowing of their airways. Symptoms often vary from person to person. The most common symptoms are:


1.   Persistent cough, irrespective of sound it makes.

2.   Wheezing – high pitch whistling sound made by narrowing of airways

3.   Breathing difficulties – sometimes the signs of airways tightening do not result in any sounds (silent asthma) we are familiar with such as wheezing and coughing.

4.   Tightening of chest / Chest pain


If you have any of the above symptoms, visit a doctor to investigate further.
