Asthma triggers are factors that start asthma symptoms or an asthma attack by irritating the airways or worsening the inflammation in the airways. These triggers can provoke attacks in individuals who already have a tendency to asthma, but they are not necessarily part of the cause of that tendency. The following triggers can cause asthma symptoms or start an asthma attack:


•   Infections, usually those caused by a virus (e.g. colds or flu)

•   Allergens, most commonly from house dust mites, pets or pollen

•   Exercise, especially in cold weather

•   Emotions, such as excitement, fear or anger

•   Irritants, such as air pollution

•   Smoking people with asthma and the parents of asthmatic children should avoid smoking

•   Changes in the weather (e.g. a cold spell)

•   Pressure on chest

•   Food additives, such as tartrazine (an artificial food colouring), or food allergens, such as peanuts (sensitised or allergic individuals can have a very severe allergic reaction).

•   Certain medications some people may be allergic to some drugs (e.g. aspirin).


When the airways have been inflamed for a long time, they become extra-sensitive. This means that they react faster and more strongly to various triggers, such as allergens, viruses, dust, smoke and stress.
