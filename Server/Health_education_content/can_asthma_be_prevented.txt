Asthma can’t be prevented entirely, but there are some practical ways to reduce the risk of an asthma attack and live well with asthma.


•   Get vaccinated for influenza: flu and other respiratory viruses are common triggers for asthma.

•   Manage any allergies: asthma and allergies are closely linked, so treating allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and avoiding or managing any allergy triggers will help with your asthma.

•   Live smoke-free: quit smoking if you smoke, and avoid any second-hand smoke (passive smoking).

•   Eat well: a balanced diet helps you to maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or obese makes asthma harder to manage.

•   Care for yourself: mental health and asthma are linked, so let a trusted friend or your doctor know if you have been feeling sad or anxious, or don’t enjoy things as much as before.

•   See your doctor regularly: asthma needs to be regularly assessed and managed, and your medication needs may change over time. Ensure your asthma action plan is up to date by checking in with your doctor regularly.
