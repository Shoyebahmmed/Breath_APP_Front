Asthma is a chronic lung disease, which can be controlled but not cured.
In clinical practice, asthma is defined by the presence of both the following:


•   excessive variation in lung function (‘variable airflow limitation’, i.e. variation in expiratory airflow that is greater than that seen in healthy people)

•   respiratory symptoms (e.g. wheeze, shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness) that vary over time and may be present or absent at any point in time.


In young children in whom lung function testing is not feasible, including most preschool children, asthma is defined by the presence of variable respiratory symptoms.

Untreated asthma is usually characterised by chronic inflammation involving many cells and cellular elements, airway hyperresponsiveness, and intermittent airway narrowing (due to bronchoconstriction, congestion or oedema of bronchial mucosa, mucus, or a combination of these).

Asthma probably represents a spectrum of conditions with different pathophysiological mechanisms. In older patients, there may be substantial overlap with the features of COPD.

The diagnosis of allergic asthma is more likely when the person also has allergy and a family history of asthma.
